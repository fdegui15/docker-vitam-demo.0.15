# KWA review : replace cron call by a systemd timer task ?
#  Pro : no external dependencies, kept in systemd
#  Pro/Con : everything in https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd/Timers#As_a_cron_replacement
#  Con : not well-known by sysadmin
#  Con : may be useless, as job scheduling inside Vitam may be delegated to a dedicated component (ihm-technical-administration)
